# This is a light weight crud app which basically takes in the details of an invoice and also outputs processed data from the invoices table.
# The aim of the project is to create a pair of master-slave databases that will serve the intended app and the currently used app respectively.
# The implementation of a master-slave schema will be best done at the server level by a cloud engineer or server admin, which is beyond the scope of the software developer.
# To get started, clone this repo, then do the following:
# 1)run migration
# 2)run seeders (the app has 2 seeders for banks table and organizations table)
# 3)Route: invoice(GET&POST)
